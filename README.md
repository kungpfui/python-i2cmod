# python-i2cmod
A Python library for some popular I2C connected sensor ICs.
Basically intended to use with Raspberry Pi and simlair single
board computers.

Yet an other implementation for some I2C connected sensors you meight think.
Well, yes and no. As I started with some humidity and pressure sensors I was
scared to see some 20% working implementations which where obvisouly not really
working. The faulty measurment values has become obvious to me, but it looked
like not for everyone. It's really hard to find proper implementations of
common I2C based sensors. So that was my starting point.
